# **App Name**: eCharge Kiosk

## Core Features:

- AI Plate Recognition: Automatic recognition of vehicle license plates using AI-powered cameras at the kiosk entrance, enabling vehicle identification and automatic charging slot assignment with zero manual input.
- Smart Slot Management: Real-time slot allocation system that assigns available chargers dynamically based on current usage, reservation status, and AI-predicted charging completion times. Supports a queue system when all slots are full.
- Vehicle-Specific Guidance: Generative AI recommends step-by-step charging instructions tailored to each vehicle's model, including charger type (AC/DC), port location, and operational instructions, displayed clearly and read aloud.
- Simplified UI: Touchscreen-first interface with full-screen display, large touch-friendly buttons, and a linear navigation flow. Designed to reduce cognitive load and eliminate multi-step menus.
- Automatic Payment: Processes payment automatically upon charging completion. Provides receipt via SMS or scannable QR code and displays real-time billing info (kWh used, duration, total cost).
- Local Business Display: Shows a curated list of nearby partner businesses (cafes, restaurants, shops) during charging wait time to encourage user engagement and local commerce.
- Wait Time Display: Queue and progress visualization that estimates remaining charging time for each occupied slot and displays real-time wait times for incoming vehicles. Includes alerts for ‚Äúalmost done‚Äù vehicles.
